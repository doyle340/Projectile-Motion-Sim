# Projectile-Motion-Sim
The first simulator in a series of education-focused Physics Sims. Simulates the particle-projectile motion near the surface of a massive body in the Newtonian Limit. 


## Some things to consider:
### Visualizations are a non-priority.
* Yes, we can use kinematics, but we can do better. Let's throw in some Lagrangians and Hamiltonians


## Adjustable parameters:
*  Planetary Mass
*  Projectile Mass
*  Initial Velocity (w/ ini'l angle)
*  Initial Force
* Default: No drag, toggle: drag
* (x,y) AND (r,theta)

## Interesting information:
*  Time of flight
*  Maximum Height
*  Minimum Height
*  Relation between horizontal range and maximum height
*  Maximum distance of projectile
*  Angle (theta)  required to hit coordinate (x,y)
